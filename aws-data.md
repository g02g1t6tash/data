Based on the search results, here are some key AWS services commonly used for data engineering and how they're typically utilized:

1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
   - Used as a data lake to store large volumes of raw data
   - Provides scalable and durable object storage
   - Often serves as the central repository for data in various formats (CSV, Parquet, etc.)

2. Amazon Redshift:
   - Data warehousing solution for analytics and business intelligence
   - Used to store and analyze large datasets efficiently
   - Enables running complex queries on structured data

3. AWS Glue:
   - Fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service
   - Used to prepare and transform data for analytics
   - Helps discover, catalog, and process data from various sources

4. Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce):
   - Managed big data platform for processing vast amounts of data
   - Supports popular frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Hive
   - Used for large-scale data processing and analysis

5. Amazon Kinesis:
   - Real-time data streaming and processing service
   - Used for ingesting and analyzing streaming data in real-time
   - Enables building real-time analytics pipelines

6. AWS Lambda:
   - Serverless compute service for running code without managing servers
   - Used for automating data processing tasks and integrating different AWS services
   - Can be used for lightweight ETL jobs and data transformations

7. Amazon Athena:
   - Interactive query service for analyzing data in S3 using standard SQL
   - Used for ad-hoc querying of data lakes without the need for data loading

8. Amazon DynamoDB:
   - Fully managed NoSQL database service
   - Used for storing and retrieving data with low-latency access requirements

9. AWS Step Functions:
   - Service for orchestrating complex workflows and managing dependencies
   - Used to design and visualize data processing pipelines

10. Amazon CloudWatch:
    - Monitoring and observability service
    - Used for monitoring data pipelines, setting alarms, and tracking metrics

These services are often used in combination to build comprehensive data engineering solutions on AWS. For example, you might use S3 for storage, Glue for ETL, Redshift for warehousing, and Athena for querying, all orchestrated using Step Functions and monitored with CloudWatch.
